IMPORTANT! to make sure everything is displayed properly make sure your "tabs" '\t' are equal to 8 spaces;


The excercise directory contains 4 program files
- cw1.h - stores the functions prototypes, includes headers of the used libraries, and preprocessor definitions.
- functions.h - stores the functions used in "cw1.c" uses the cw1.h header file
- cw1.c - main program file.
- writeID.c - an example program from which, after using make,an executable is created which you should input as an argument to the main program, to get the desired result

//ABOUT THE PROGRAM
It's a simple program that run a for loops to create fork 3 times.
each child "commits suicide" after execlp that prints its process ID's


//MAKE
using make compiles the main program using gcc creating an exe. named "run1" recompiling if there has been any change to the program itself or its headers.

It also creates another exe. the new program to be used to print children process ID statements, 
called writeID.o which relative location you should input as a command line argument to ./run1 to get the desired result or simply use-make run

the correct program call after using make looks like this:
- make
- ./run1 ./writeID.o or simply make run
- arg[0]  arg[1]

using "make clean" cleans the program of the exe files.
